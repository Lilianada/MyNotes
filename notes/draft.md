Subject: Application for Software Engineering Internship at Vercel

Hi there,

My name is Lilian, and this is my application to become the 700th employee at Vercel.

AI is set to revolutionize the world of frontend development. We all know this, so what better way to stay ahead than by joining the pioneers leading this change?

What excites me most about Vercel is its commitment to:
- Empowering developers with tools that simplify workflows, from development to deployment  
- Pioneering frontend technologies that prioritize speed, accessibility, and scalability  
- Fostering collaboration through features that help diverse teams work together seamlessly  

I’m especially thrilled about the launch of Vercel’s new AI product, **v0**, which is setting a new standard for integrating artificial intelligence into web applications. Its ability to enhance user experience with cutting-edge machine learning technology truly demonstrates Vercel's vision for the future.

My goal is to show what’s possible when AI meets creativity and innovation. We live in an era where working smarter matters more than working harder. You don’t need to learn a new skill every time you want to create something impactful, or hire a new person for every task. Tools like Vercel’s v0 make this vision a reality by enabling developers to achieve more with less effort.

Recently, I had the opportunity to work on Minispace.dev, a lightweight and fast blogging platform for non-developers and tech-savvy people who want to own a mini space on the internet. Thanks to v0, which wrote the first lines of code, my app came to life. Additionally, I built MINI app, a minimalist reading and writing platform-think Medium, but without the extra features or distractions. Both projects, along with many others, were built with Next.js and deployed on Vercel. These experiences have deepened my appreciation for how Vercel empowers developers to create and scale impactful applications.

As a female developer of African descent, I bring a unique perspective to the table. My background gives me a deep understanding of the challenges faced in underrepresented regions, and I am passionate about leveraging technology to create solutions that bridge gaps and drive inclusivity. I believe my distinct outlook and dedication to crafting meaningful experiences align perfectly with Vercel’s mission of advancing the web.

I would love the chance to contribute to your team as a software engineering intern, bringing my enthusiasm, creativity, and technical skills to help push the boundaries of what’s possible with Vercel.

Looking forward to your response!

Best regards,
