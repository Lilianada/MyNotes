# Bug Fix Testing Summary

## Tests Implemented

### Unit Tests
1. **EditHistoryService Tests** 
   - Configuration initialization and updates
   - Note tracking initialization and cleanup
   - Content change tracking behavior
   - Note switching behavior and isolation

2. **useEditHistory Hook Tests**
   - Initialization of note tracking
   - Cleanup on unmount and note switching
   - Content change tracking and saving

3. **ContextNoteEditor Component Tests**
   - Rendering with selected note
   - Cleanup when switching between notes
   - Content update handling

### Integration Tests
1. **Note Switching Test**
   - Preserving content when switching between notes
   - Ensuring changes to one note don't affect others

### Manual Testing Guide
Created a comprehensive manual testing guide that covers:
- Basic note switching
- Rapid switching
- Unsaved changes testing
- Large content testing
- Edit history testing
- Browser refresh scenarios
- Session end scenarios

## Next Steps

1. **Expand Test Coverage**
   - Add tests for edge cases (empty notes, very large notes)
   - Add tests for local storage interactions
   - Test autosave timer behavior more thoroughly

2. **Performance Testing**
   - Ensure the edit history tracking doesn't cause performance issues with large notes
   - Test with many notes (50+) to ensure the system scales

3. **User Testing**
   - Have actual users follow the manual testing guide
   - Collect feedback on any remaining issues

4. **Monitoring**
   - Add additional logging to help diagnose any future issues
   - Consider adding analytics to track note switching patterns

5. **Documentation**
   - Update developer documentation to explain the edit history system
   - Document the isolation mechanisms to help prevent future bugs

## Potential Future Improvements

1. **Enhance Edit History UI**
   - Add a visual indicator when autosave occurs
   - Add a history browser to see and restore past versions

2. **Optimize Storage**
   - Implement differential storage to reduce the size of history entries
   - Add compression for large notes

3. **Conflict Resolution**
   - Implement better handling for simultaneous edits from multiple devices
   - Add visual merge tools for conflicting changes
