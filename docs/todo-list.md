## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Core Issues

### State Management Problems
- **Complex Context Structure**: Overly nested providers causing performance issues
- **Custom DOM Events**: Anti-pattern usage of `document.addEventListener` for React communication
- **Excessive Re-renders**: Poor optimization leading to performance degradation
- **Prop Drilling**: Excessive props passed through multiple component levels

### Recommended Solutions
- Replace custom DOM events with proper React state management
- Implement Zustand or Jotai for cleaner state management
- Consolidate related context providers
- Use React.memo and useMemo strategically

---

## ‚ö° Performance Optimization

- **Large Bundle Size**: Unoptimized dependencies

### Performance Solutions
- Implement lazy loading for Monaco Editor
- Add virtualization for long note lists
- Break down large components (200+ lines) into focused units
