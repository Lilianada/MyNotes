# Autosave Bug Fix Summary

## Issue
There was a bug in the `performAutosave` method of the `EditHistoryService` class where it was attempting to access `historyEntry.changePercentage` in the console.log statement even when `historyEntry` was not defined in the case of minor changes.

## Fix
1. Added a `diff` variable that calculates text difference metrics regardless of whether a history entry is created
2. Modified the log statement to use `diff.changePercentage` instead of `historyEntry.changePercentage`

## Technical Details
The issue occurred in the `performAutosave` method in `/Users/lilian/Desktop/Projects/NoteIt-down/lib/edit-history/edit-history-service.ts`. The method had a conditional check that would only create a `historyEntry` object if the changes were significant enough, but then tried to access that object in a logging statement outside of the conditional block.

### Before:
```typescript
// Check if the change is significant enough to create a history entry
const shouldAddToHistory = shouldCreateHistoryEntry(lastContent, newContent);

if (shouldAddToHistory) {
  // Create history entry for significant changes
  const historyEntry = createHistoryEntry(lastContent, newContent, 'autosave');
  await this.saveWithHistory(noteId, newContent, historyEntry, isAdmin, user);
} else {
  // For minor changes, just update content without adding to history
  // ...
}

// Update tracking
this.lastSavedContent.set(noteId, newContent);
this.pendingChanges.delete(noteId);
this.autosaveTimers.delete(noteId);

// BUG: historyEntry is only defined in the 'if' block but used here always
console.log(`[EditHistory] Autosaved note ${noteId} with ${historyEntry.changePercentage?.toFixed(1)}% changes`);
```

### After:
```typescript
// Calculate change metrics for logging regardless of whether we create a history entry
const diff = calculateTextDifference(lastContent, newContent);

// Check if the change is significant enough to create a history entry
const shouldAddToHistory = shouldCreateHistoryEntry(lastContent, newContent);

if (shouldAddToHistory) {
  // Create history entry for significant changes
  const historyEntry = createHistoryEntry(lastContent, newContent, 'autosave');
  await this.saveWithHistory(noteId, newContent, historyEntry, isAdmin, user);
} else {
  // For minor changes, just update content without adding to history
  // ...
}

// Update tracking
this.lastSavedContent.set(noteId, newContent);
this.pendingChanges.delete(noteId);
this.autosaveTimers.delete(noteId);

// Fixed: always use diff which is defined outside of conditional blocks
console.log(`[EditHistory] Autosaved note ${noteId} with ${diff.changePercentage.toFixed(1)}% changes`);
```

## Effects of Fix
- Prevents potential `TypeError` when accessing undefined properties
- Ensures logging works correctly for all types of changes
- Maintains the same functionality for both significant and minor changes
- Doesn't affect the autosave interval which is already set to 10 seconds

## Verification
The fix was verified using targeted tests that specifically check for the resolution of the issue. The tests ensure that the method can handle both minor and significant changes without errors related to undefined variables.
