# Error Handling Improvements

This document outlines the improvements made to handle errors when cleaning up note tracking during the editing process.

## Issue Identified

When cleaning up note tracking during note switching or component unmount, the application would encounter errors like:

```
[EditHistory] Note 1747743546184 not found in localStorage Error
```

This happened when trying to save pending changes for a note that had been deleted or didn't exist in localStorage.

## Fixes Implemented

1. **Enhanced Error Checking in cleanupTracking**
   - Added checks to verify if a note exists in localStorage before trying to save pending changes
   - Added try/catch blocks to prevent errors from disrupting the cleanup process
   - Added more detailed logging to help diagnose issues

2. **Improved Error Handling in edit-history-hooks.ts**
   - Added try/catch blocks in cleanup functions
   - Added validation to ensure notes exist before attempting operations
   - Enhanced error logging for better diagnostics

3. **Added Note Existence Validation in context-note-editor.tsx**
   - Added checks to verify if notes still exist before attempting cleanup
   - Implemented graceful handling when notes no longer exist
   - Added proper error boundaries to prevent unmount errors

4. **Enhanced saveWithHistory Method**
   - Added special handling for autosave operations during cleanup
   - Added note existence validation before attempting saves
   - Improved error messages to better indicate the source of problems

## Tests Added

- Created specific tests for error handling in nonexistent note scenarios
- Added test cases to verify proper cleanup behavior when notes don't exist
- Enhanced test coverage for edge cases in note switching

## Future Recommendations

1. **Enhanced Logging**
   - Consider adding more structured logging to track note lifecycle events
   - Log note IDs consistently to make debugging easier

2. **Note ID Validation**
   - Consider adding validation to ensure note IDs are properly formatted
   - Add checks to ensure note IDs in localStorage match expected patterns

3. **Cleanup Management**
   - Consider adding a centralized registry of notes being tracked
   - Implement periodic cleanup to remove tracking for notes that no longer exist
